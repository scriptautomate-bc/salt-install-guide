* Packages and all required dependencies created by Salt Project or official
  upstream packager.
* Packages hosted by the Salt Project.
* Tested by the Salt Project.

Reasonable-effort support policy by operating system
====================================================
This section outlines the general support policy for each operating system that
is listed as having reasonable-effort support by the Salt Project. These
guidelines are intended to help you understand how long a particular operating
system might receive reasonable-effort support.

Since the Salt Project does not create or maintain the packages for these
operating systems, no guarantee is made as to availability of packages. These
guidelines are for reasonable-effort support only.


openSUSE
--------
openSUSE version support mirrors that of the upstream maintainer.
